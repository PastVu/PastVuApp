# PastVuApp

![A blue star in a pink circle](img/logo.png)

This app implements the [PastVu website](https://pastvu.com/) in form of an
application. 

It's written in ReactNative and TypeScript + Expo, so it's intended to be
cross-platform (it can run on both Android and iOS).

The iOS version has not been implemented nor tested yet.
